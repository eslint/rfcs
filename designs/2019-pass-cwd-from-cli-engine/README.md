# Pass cwd from cli engine

## Summary
Make the CLIEngine `cwd` option available to rules to avoid the misalignment between it and process.cwd()

see: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11218

## Motivation
To avoid the misalignment between it and `process.cwd()`.
There is a situation where a rule need to get the relative path of the current file to the root folder of the project.
But it's hard to guarantee that all developers will open the root folder in their IDE (VSCode with eslint plugin for example), especially when the project grows.

Use case:
Say, the project is supposed to be open in `web` folder.
But as the project grows, people tends to open some subfolder under the `web` to minimize sidebar.
`eslint` plugin in VSCode will then run the `eslint` from the subfolder which cause the `process.cwd` not to return the expected value (e.g. the `web` folder)

Expected:
It is expected that the rule has access to the `cwd` in the option of the CLI engine.

## Detailed Design
### Change in Linter
Modify the `Linter` constructor to accept an object with a optional string parameter `cwd` with a default value.
```
const linter = new Linter({
  cwd: '/path/to/cwd'
});
```
or `const linter = new Linter({})`.
The default value will be `process.cwd()` if the `process` exists, or `undefined` if not.


### Change in Context
This RFC adds `getCwd()` method to rule context.
The `getCwd()` method returns the value of the `cwd` option that was given in `Linter` constructor.

## Documentation
Adding the `cwd` into the `context` Api.
Adding the `cwd` into the `Linter` constructor Api.

## Drawbacks
Can't think of any.

## Backwards Compatibility Analysis
Those rules using `process.cwd` will have exact same behavior, so there is no compatibility issue.
