# `LinterShell` Class Replacing `CLIEngine`

## Summary

This RFC adds a new class `LinterShell` that provides asynchronous API and deprecates `CLIEngine`.

## Motivation

- We have functionality that cannot be supported with the current synchronous API. For example, ESLint verifying files in parallel, formatters printing progress state, formatters printing results in streams etc. A move to an asynchronous API would be beneficial and a new `LinterShell` class can be created with an async API in mind from the start.
- Node.js has supported [ES modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) stably since `13.2.0`. Because Node.js doesn't provide any way that loads ES modules synchronously from CJS, ESLint cannot load configs/plugins that are written as ES modules. And migrating to asynchronous API opens up doors to support those.
- The name of `CLIEngine`, our primary API, has caused confusion in the community and is sub-optimal. We have a lot of issues that say "please use `CLIEngine` instead.". A new class, `LinterShell`, while fixing other issues, will also make our primary API more clear.

## Detailed Design

### Add new `LinterShell` class

This RFC adds a new class `LinterShell`. It has almost the same methods as `CLIEngine`, but the return value of some methods are different.

- [constructor()](#-constructor)
- [lintFiles()](#-the-lintfiles-method) (rename from `executeOnFiles()`)
- [lintText()](#-the-linttext-method) (rename from `executeOnText()`)
- [getFormatter()](#-the-getformatter-method)
- [static outputFixesInIteration()](#-the-outputfixesiniteration-method) (rename from `outputFixes()`)
- [static extractErrorResults()](#-the-extracterrorresults-method) (rename from `getErrorResults()`)
- [getConfigForFile()](#-the-other-methods)
- [isPathIgnored()](#-the-other-methods)
- ~~addPlugin()~~ (move to a constructor option)
- ~~getRules()~~ (delete)
- ~~resolveFileGlobPatterns()~~ (delete)
- [static compareResultsByFilePath()](#-new-methods) (new)

Initially the `LinterShell` class will be a wrapper around `CLIEngine`, modifying return types. Later it can take on a more independent shape as `CLIEngine` gets more deprecated.

#### ● Constructor

The constructor has mostly the same options as `CLIEngine`, but with some differences:

- It throws fatal errors if the options contain unknown properties or an option is invalid type ([eslint/eslint#10272](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10272)).
- It disallows the deprecated `cacheFile` option.
- The array of the `plugins` option can contain objects `{ id: string; definition: Object }` along with strings. If the objects are present, the `id` property is the plugin ID and the `definition` property is the definition of the plugin. This is the successor of `addPlugin()` method. See also "[The other methods](#-the-other-methods)" section.

<details>
<summary>A rough sketch of the constructor.</summary>

```js
class LinterShell {
  constructor({
    allowInlineConfig = true,
    baseConfig = null,
    cache = false,
    cacheLocation = ".eslintcache",
    configFile = null,
    cwd = process.cwd(),
    envs = [],
    extensions = [".js"],
    fix = false,
    fixTypes = ["problem", "suggestion", "layout"],
    globInputPaths = true,
    globals = [],
    ignore = true,
    ignorePath = null,
    ignorePattern = [],
    parser = "espree",
    parserOptions = null,
    plugins = [],
    reportUnusedDisableDirectives = false,
    resolvePluginsRelativeTo = cwd,
    rulePaths = [],
    rules = null,
    useEslintrc = true,
    ...unknownOptions
  } = {}) {
    // Throws on unknown options
    if (Object.keys(unknownOptions).length >= 1) {
      //...
    }
    // Throws on the invalid value of options
    if (typeof allowInlineConfig !== "boolean") {
      // ...
    }
    if (typeof baseConfig !== "object") {
      // ...
    }
    // and other options...

    // Initialize CLIEngine because this is a tiny wrapper.
    const engine = (this._cliEngine = new CLIEngine({
      allowInlineConfig,
      baseConfig,
      cache,
      cacheLocation,
      configFile,
      cwd,
      envs,
      extensions,
      fix,
      fixTypes,
      globInputPaths,
      globals,
      ignore,
      ignorePath,
      ignorePattern,
      parser,
      parserOptions,
      plugins: plugins.map(p => (typeof p === "string" ? p : p.id)),
      reportUnusedDisableDirectives,
      resolvePluginsRelativeTo,
      rulePaths,
      rules,
      useEslintrc,
    }))

    // Add the definitions of the `plugins` option.
    if (plugins) {
      for (const plugin of plugins) {
        if (typeof plugin === "object" && plugin !== null) {
          engine.addPlugin(plugin.id, plugin.definition)
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>For `plugins` example.</summary>

```js
const { LinterShell } = require("eslint")
const linter = new LinterShell({
  plugins: [
    "foo",
    "eslint-plugin-bar",
    { id: "abc", definition: require("./path/to/a-plugin") },
  ],
})
```

</details>

#### ● The `lintFiles()` method

This method corresponds to `CLIEngine#executeOnFiles()`.

This method returns an object that implements [AsyncIterable] and [AsyncIterator], as similar to async generators. Therefore we can use the returned object with `for-await-of` statement.

```js
const { LinterShell } = require("eslint")
const linter = new LinterShell()

for await (const result of linter.lintFiles(patterns)) {
  print(result)
}
```

The returned object yields the lint result of each file immediately when it has finished linting each file. Therefore, ESLint doesn't guarantee the order of the iteration. The order is random.

This method must not throw any errors synchronously. Errors may happen in iteration asynchronously.

<details>
<summary>A rough sketch of the `lintFiles()` method.</summary>

A tiny wrapper of `CLIEngine`.

```js
class LinterShell {
  async *lintFiles(patterns) {
    yield* this._cliEngine.executeOnFiles(patterns).results
  }
}
```

But once [RFC42] is implemented, the returned object will be an instance of [`LintResultGenerator`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/836c0e48704d70bc1a5cbdbf0211368b0ada942d/lib/eslint/lint-result-generator.js#L136) class.

</details>

If you want to use the returned object with `await` expression, you can use a small utility to convert an async iterable object to an array.

```js
const toArray = require("@async-generators/to-array").default
const { LinterShell } = require("eslint")
const linter = new LinterShell()

// Convert the results to an array.
const results = await toArray(linter.lintFiles(patterns))

// Optionally you can sort the results.
results.sort(LinterShell.compareResultsByFilePath)

print(results)
```

Once we got this change, we can realize the following things:

- [RFC42] We can implement linting in parallel by worker threads. It will reduce spending time of linting much.
- [RFC45] We can implement to print the results in streaming or to print progress state, without more breaking changes. Because ESLint may spend time to lint files (for example, ESLint needs about 20 seconds to lint [our codebase](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)), to print progress state will be useful.
- (no RFC yet) We can support ES modules for shareable configs, plugins, and custom parsers.

##### Iterate only one time

We can iterate the returned object of this method only one time similar to generators.

```js
const { LinterShell } = require("eslint")
const linter = new LinterShell()

const resultGenerator = linter.lintFiles(patterns)
for await (const result of resultGenerator) {
  print(result)
}
// ↓ Throw "This generator has been consumed already"
for await (const result of resultGenerator) {
  print(result)
}
```

##### Move the `usedDeprecatedRules` property

The returned object of `CLIEngine#executeOnFiles()` has the `usedDeprecatedRules` property that includes the deprecated rule IDs which the linting used.

But the location doesn't fit asynchronous because the used deprecated rule list is not determined until the iteration finished. Therefore, this RFC moves the `usedDeprecatedRules` property to each lint result.

```js
const { LinterShell } = require("eslint")
const linter = new LinterShell()

for await (const result of linter.lintFiles(patterns)) {
  console.log(result.usedDeprecatedRules)
}
```

As a side-effect, formatters gets the capability to print the used deprecated rules. Previously, ESLint has not passed the returned object to formatters, so the formatters could not print used deprecated rules. After this RFC, each lint result has the `usedDeprecatedRules` property and the formatters receive those.

##### Write cache safely (best effort)

Because this method updates the cache file, it will break the cache file if called multiple times in parallel. To prevent that, this method doesn't write the cache file if the cache file has been updated since this method read.

This method does this check with the best effort (e.g., check `mtime` of the cache file) because Node.js doesn't provide the way that reads/writes a file exclusively.

If the cache file was broken, this method should ignore the cache file and does lint.

##### Abort linting

The iterator interface has optional [`return()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator/return) that forces to finish the iterator. The `for-of`/`for-await-of` syntax calls the `return()` method automatically if the loop is stopped through a `braek`, `return`, or `throw`.

ESLint aborts linting when the `return()` method is called. The first `return()` method call does:

- ESLint cancels the linting of all pending files.
- ESLint updates the cache file with the current state. Therefore, the next time, ESLint can use the cache of the already linted files and lint only the canceled files.
- ESLint will terminate all workers if [RFC42] is implemented.

```js
const { LinterShell } = require("eslint")
const linter = new LinterShell()

for await (const result of linter.lintFiles(patterns)) {
  if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
    break // abort linting.
  }
}
```

The second and later calls do nothing.

#### ● The `lintText()` method

This method corresponds to `CLIEngine#executeOnText()`.

This method returns the same type of an object as the `lintFiles()` method.

Because the returned object of `CLIEngine#executeOnText()` method is the same type as the `CLIEngine#executeOnFiles()` method. The `LinterShell` class inherits that mannar.

```js
const { LinterShell } = require("eslint")
const linter = new LinterShell()

for await (const result of linter.lintText(text, filePath)) {
  print(result)
}
```

Example: Using along with the `lintFiles()` method.

```js
const { LinterShell } = require("eslint")
const linter = new LinterShell()

const report = useStdin
  ? linter.lintText(text, filePath)
  : linter.lintFiles(patterns)

for await (const result of report) {
  print(result)
}
```

#### ● The `getFormatter()` method

This method returns a `Promise<Formatter>`. The `Formatter` type is a function `(results: AsyncIterable<LintResult>) => AsyncIterable<string>`. It receives lint results then outputs the formatted text.

```js
const { LinterShell } = require("eslint")
const linter = new LinterShell()
const formatter = linter.getFormatter("stylish")

// Verify files
const results = linter.lintFiles(patterns)
// Format and write the results
for await (const textPiece of formatter(results)) {
  process.stdout.write(textPiece)
}
```

This means the `getFormatter()` method wraps the current formatter to adapt the interface.

<details>
<summary>A rough sketch of the `getFormatter()` method.</summary>

```js
class LinterShell {
  async getFormatter(name) {
    const format = this._cliEngine.getFormatter(name)

    // Return the wrapper.
    return async function* formatter(resultIterator) {
      // Collect and sort the results.
      const results = await toArray(resultIterator)
      results.sort(LinterShell.compareResultsByFilePath)

      // Make `rulesMeta`.
      const rules = this._cliEngine.getRules()
      const rulesMeta = getRulesMeta(rules)

      // Format the results with the formatter of the current spec.
      yield format(results, { rulesMeta })
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Once we got this change, we can realize the following things:

- [RFC45] We can implement to print the results in streaming or to print progress state, without more breaking changes.
- (no RFC yet) We can support ES modules for custom formatters.

#### ● The `outputFixesInIteration()` method

The original `CLIEngine.outputFixes()` static method writes the fix results to the source code files.

The goal of this method is same as the `CLIEngine.outputFixes()` method, but we cannot share async iterators with this method and formatters, so this method receives an `AsyncIterable<LintResult>` object as the first argument then return an `AsyncIterable<LintResult>` object. This method is sandwiched between `lintFiles()` and formatters.

```js
const { LinterShell } = require("eslint")
const linter = new LinterShell()
const formatter = linter.getFormatter("stylish")

// Verify files
let results = linter.lintFiles(patterns)
// Update the files of the results if needed
if (process.argv.includes("--fix")) {
  results = LinterShell.outputFixesInIteration(results)
}
// Format and write the results
for await (const textPiece of formatter(results)) {
  process.stdout.write(textPiece)
}
```

#### ● The `extractErrorResults()` method

The original `CLIEngine.getErrorResults()` static method receives an array of lint results, then extracts only the messages, which are error severity, then returns the results that contain only those.

This method just changed the arrays to async iterables because this method is sandwiched between `lintFiles()` and formatters.

```js
const { LinterShell } = require("eslint")
const linter = new LinterShell()
const formatter = linter.getFormatter("stylish")

// Verify files
let results = linter.lintFiles(patterns)
// Extract only error results
if (process.argv.includes("--quiet")) {
  results = LinterShell.extractErrorResults(results)
}
// Format and write the results
for await (const textPiece of formatter(results)) {
  process.stdout.write(textPiece)
}
```

#### ● The other methods

The following methods return `Promise` which gets fulfilled with each result. Once we got this change, we can support ES modules for shareable configs, plugins, and custom parsers without more breaking changes.

- `getConfigForFile()`
- `isPathIgnored()`

The following methods are removed because those don't fit the new API.

- `addPlugin()` ... This method has caused to confuse people. We have introduced this method to add plugin implementations and expected people to use this method to test plugins. But people have often thought that this method loads a new plugin for the following linting so they can use plugins rules without `plugins` setting. And this method is only one that mutates the state of `CLIEngine` objects and messes all caches. Therefore, this RFC moves this functionality to a constructor option. See also "[Constructor](#-constructor)" section.
- `getRules()` ... This method returns the map that contains core rules and the rules of the plugin that the previous `executeOnFiles()` method call used. This behavior is surprised and forces us to store the config objects that the previous `executeOnFiles()` method call used. This proposal removes this method and a separated RFC (maybe [RFC47]) will add the successor.
- `resolveFileGlobPatterns()` ... ESLint doesn't use this logic since `v6.0.0`, but it has stayed there for backward compatibility. Once [RFC20] is implemented, what ESLint iterates and what the glob of this method iterates will be different, then it will confuse users. This is good timing to remove the legacy.

#### ● New methods

- `compareResultsByFilePath()` ... This method receives two lint results then returns `+1`, `-1`, or `0`. This method is intended to use in order to sort results.

  <details>
  <summary>A rough sketch of the `compareResultsByFilePath()` method.</summary>

  ```js
  class LinterShell {
    static compareResultsByFilePath(a, b) {
      if (a.filePath < b.filePath) {
        return -1
      }
      if (a.filePath > b.filePath) {
        return 1
      }
      return 0
    }
  }
  ```

  </details>

### ■ Deprecate `CLIEngine` class

This RFC soft-deprecates `CLIEngine` class. Because:

- It's tough to maintain two versions (sync and async) of implementation. The two are almost copy-pasted stuff, but hard to share the code. We can freeze the synchronous version of code by deprecation.
- In the future, `CLIEngine` get not-supported features such as [RFC42], [RFC45], ES modules, etc because of synchronous API. This difference may be surprising for API users, but we can explain that as "Because `CLIEngine` has been deprecated, we don't add any new features into that class."

### ■ Out of scope

- Not change API for rules. This RFC doesn't change APIs that rule implementation uses. We may be able to support asynchronous stuff in rules in the future, but it's out of this RFC's scope.
- Not change internal logics. This RFC just adds the public interface that is asynchronous. It would be a wrapper of `CLIEngine` for now.

## Documentation

- The "[Node.js API](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/nodejs-api)" page should describe the new public API and deprecation of `CLIEngine` class.

## Drawbacks

People that use `CLIEngine` have to update their application with the new API. It will need hard work.

## Backwards Compatibility Analysis

If we assume [RFC44] will be merged, this RFC is a drastic change, but not a breaking change until we decide to remove `CLIEngine` class.

This RFC just adds `LinterShell` class and deprecates `CLIEngine` class. We can do both in a minor release.

## Alternatives

### Alternatives for the new class

Adding `CLIEngine#executeOnFilesAsync()` method is an alternative.

**Pros:**

- It's smaller change than adding `LinterShell` class.

**Cons:**

- We have to maintain both synchronous and asynchronous APIs. It's kind of hard works.
  - We can deprecate the synchronous version, but in that case, I feel odd because `executeOnFiles()` is the essential name of `executeOnFilesAsync()`.
- We need the asynchronous version of the other APIs in the future. The `getFormatterAsync()` is needed for formatters with progress. The asynchronous version of the other methods is needed for ES modules.
  - `CLIEngine` will get huge because we cannot share the most code between asynchronous API and synchronous API.
  - API users need the number of API migrations.
- It causes confusion for API users. As Node.js built-in libraries are so, I guess that people expect the two (`executeOnFiles()` and `executeOnFilesAsync()`) to have exactly the same features. However, it's impossible. We have a bundle of the features that we cannot support on synchronous API, such as linting in parallel, formatters with progress, ES modules, etc.

Therefore, I think that introducing the new class that has only asynchronous API makes more sense. This RFC solves:

- We can freeze the code of the synchronous version of our API by deprecating `CLIEngine`. This reduces the maintenance cost of duplicate codes.
- We can reduce the number of API migrations for API users.
- We can reduce the confusion of similar but different methods.
- And as a bonus, we can reduce the confusion of the name of `CLIEngine`.

### Alternatives for [Asynchronous Iteration](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration)

Using [streams](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/stream.html) instead is an alternative.

**Pros:**

- We can introduce `LinterShell` class in a minor release. (To use Async Iteration, we have to wait for [RFC44]).

**Cons:**

- Streams are problematic a bit about error propagation.
  - [straem.pipeline()](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream_pipeline_streams_callback) function reduces this pain, but [it doesn't cover all cases](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/26311).
- We have to wait for Node.js `v11.14.0` to use streams with `for-await-of` syntax.

Because Node.js 8 will be EOL two months later, we should be able to use Asynchronous Iteration soon. And Iterator interface is smaller spec than streams, and it's easy to use.

### Alternatives for disallow execution in parallel

- Throwing if the previous call has not finished yet (fail-fast).
- Aborting the previous call then run (steal ownership of the cache file).

are alternatives. Both cases stop the previous or current call. It may be surprising users.

- Waiting the previous call internally.

The access of the cache file finishes regardless of the progress of the iterator that the method returned. It means that API users cannot know when the file access finished. On the other hand, because `LinterShell` objects know when the file access finished, it can execute the next call at the proper timing.

However, the `LinterShell` objects cannot know the existence of other threads and processes that write the cache file. The current way has a smaller risk than the alternatives.
