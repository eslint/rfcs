# plugins.eslint.org Website

## Summary

<!-- One-paragraph explanation of the feature. -->

This is a proposal to create a plugins.eslint.org website to host documentation for plugins maintained by the ESLint team: currently [`eslint/json`](https://github.com/eslint/json) and [`eslint/markdown`](https://github.com/eslint/markdown).

## Motivation

<!-- Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome? -->

In the [2024-08-22 TSC meeting](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/blob/main/notes/2024/2024-08-22.md) it was agreed to create a website at the subdomain plugins.eslint.org to host documentation for the plugins [`eslint/json`](https://github.com/eslint/json) and [`eslint/markdown`](https://github.com/eslint/markdown). This will improve discoverability for these plugins. The purpose of this RFC is to discuss the details of the implementation of the new website.

For the initial implementation, the intent is to start with only a minimal set of necessary features. More stuff will be added later as needed.

## Detailed Design

<!--
   This is the bulk of the RFC.

   Explain the design with enough detail that someone familiar with ESLint
   can implement it by reading this document. Please get into specifics
   of your approach, corner cases, and examples of how the change will be
   used. Be sure to define any new terms in this section.
-->

_Not much detail yet, see [Open Questions](#open-questions) below._

Each plugin contains a `README.md` file whose content should be rendered in the website at a URL to be specified.
`eslint/markdown` also contains several `.md` files in the `docs` directory that should be also rendered in the website.

Additionally to the static content in the documentation files, it should be possible to include specific autogenerated information on certain pages like the version number of a package or the date of the last release.

We will also need a main page whose content should be editable in a GitHub repo (as markdown, HTML, or other format).
It is unclear how this will work given that two repos are involved.

`eslint` and `eslint.org` use Eleventy to generate web pages from markdown files and other metadata.
The new website could use Eleventy or another similar tool.
Any tool will require a specific configuration that will be kept in the repos along with the documentation pages and other assets for website.

A TSC member will have to create and configure a new site in Netlify.
This site will serve the domain plugins.eslint.org.
If possible, the site should be linked to both GitHub repos [`eslint/json`](https://github.com/eslint/json) and [`eslint/markdown`](https://github.com/eslint/markdown).
If not, we will need to think about it.
The intent is to be able to update the site to automatically from both repos on a specific trigger.

It may be also necessary to create a new token for Netlify to fetch data from the repos (I do not know if the current token is automatically enabled to access the new repos or not).

**TODO:**
* collect suggestions and elaborate
* add task list

## Documentation

<!--
    How will this RFC be documented? Does it need a formal announcement
    on the ESLint blog to explain the motivation?
-->

It would be good to announce the new website on the usual channels when it's ready (ESLint blog, X aka Twitter, Mastodon, Discord).

## Drawbacks

<!--
    Why should we *not* do this? Consider why adding this into ESLint
    might not benefit the project or the community. Attempt to think 
    about any opposing viewpoints that reviewers might bring up. 

    Any change has potential downsides, including increased maintenance
    burden, incompatibility with other tools, breaking existing user
    experience, etc. Try to identify as many potential problems with
    implementing this RFC as possible.
-->

The ESLint team has limited bandwith, and the new website will require effort for setup and maintainance.

## Backwards Compatibility Analysis

<!--
    How does this change affect existing ESLint users? Will any behavior
    change for them? If so, how are you going to minimize the disruption
    to existing users?
-->

Not relevant for this proposal.

## Alternatives

<!--
    What other designs did you consider? Why did you decide against those?

    This section should also include prior art, such as whether similar
    projects have already implemented a similar feature.
-->

**TODO:** add dismissed suggestions here

## Open Questions

<!--
    This section is optional, but is suggested for a first draft.

    What parts of this proposal are you unclear about? What do you
    need to know before you can finalize this RFC?

    List the questions that you'd like reviewers to focus on. When
    you've received the answers and updated the design to reflect them, 
    you can remove this section.
-->

* How can we coordinate one website across multiple repos?
* What changes to the infrastructure (not code changes) will be necessary? For example:
  * Configure a new site in Netlify
  * Create new GitHub tokens for the website to fetch data from the repos
  * …
* What content will be shown on the main page?
* When will the website be updated? Common options would be during a release, when the main branch is updated, or using a manual trigger.
* What is the _minimal_ set of features we should have right from the beginning? E.g.
  * List of sponsors
  * Version support policy
  * Version-specific URLs (i.e. `v6.x`, `head`, `latest`, etc.)
  * Deploy previews
  * Translations
  * Ligth/dark themes
  * A dedicated design
  * …

## Help Needed

<!--
    This section is optional.

    Are you able to implement this RFC on your own? If not, what kind
    of help would you need from the team?
-->

Any help in defining the details of this change or with the subsequent implementation will be greatly appreciated.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<!--
    This section is optional but suggested.

    Try to anticipate points of clarification that might be needed by
    the people reviewing this RFC. Include those questions and answers
    in this section.
