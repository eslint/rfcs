# Exporting a `definePlugin` function

## Summary

Proposes a `definePlugin` function to `@eslint/plugin-kit` as the recommended way to group plugin configs, meta, and rules.

## Motivation

Defining the exported values of an ESLint plugin is a "loose" process right now.
ESLint core provides only recommendations, not standardized factory functions; the community also has centralized only on common patterns.
Several dozen variations in how plugins are defined have evolved, ranging from manual declarations of `configs`, to custom scripts, to auto-generated JavaScript or TypeScript files.

This divergence in implementation details results in conceptual and practical overhead for plugin authors.
Without a standardized factory function to define a plugin:

- There is no first-party way for plugins to receive type hints during development the way [`eslint/config`'s `defineConfig`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#configuration-file) assists in authoring configs
- Plugin names are often defined in at least four separate places:
  - `configs[string].name`, such as `"example/recommended"`
  - `configs[string].rules`, such as `{ "example/rule": "error" }`
  - `rules[string]`, such as `{ "example/rule": { ... } }`
  - `meta.name`, such as `"eslint-plugin-example"`
- Onboarding to a new plugin necessitates learning its -often unique- way of generating configs
- `configs` and `rules` often cross-reference each other, so there is no single clean way to define them in one statement:

  - Some plugins imperatively define properties in two steps as suggested in the [ESLint plugin documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins#configs-in-plugins):

    ```js
    const plugin = {
      meta: { name, version },
      configs: {},
      rules,
    };

    Object.assign(plugin.configs, {
      recommended: [
        {
          plugins: {
            example: plugin,
          },
          rules: recommendedRules,
        },
      ],
    });
    ```

  - Other plugins use [a single computed `get()` for `plugins`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/914319ae595010cd5d3f0e277c77eb86da18e4f0/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/index.ts#L30):

    ```js
    export const plugin = {
      configs: {
        recommended: {
          name: "example/recommended",
          plugins: {
            get example() {
              return plugin;
            },
          },
          rules,
        },
      },
      meta: { name, version },
      rules: recommendedRules,
    };
    ```

This RFC proposes creating a `definePlugin` function to be exported from `@eslint/plugin-kit`.
It would provide a single recommended factory for defining the structure of a typical ESLint plugin.
`definePlugin` would automate the parts of plugin definitions that many plugins manually redefine:

- Using the plugin and rule names in multiple places
- Populating config values based on lists of rules

As with `defineConfig`, `definePlugin` would be a purely optional, additive change.
Existing and future plugins would continue to work as-is without a `definePlugin` call.

## Detailed Design

The `@eslint/plugin-kit` package would export a `definePlugin` function that takes in a single required options object.
The options properties would allow authors to specify:

- `meta` _(required)_: The same `name` as [Meta Data in Plugins](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins#meta-data-in-plugins), along with an optional `version`
- `rules` _(optional)_: The same objectÂ as [Rules in Plugins](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins#rules-in-plugins), but also allowing functions that return a rule
- any other plugin properties

It would return a plugin with:

- `configs`: configuration object(s) generated per [Configs](#configs)
- all other provided properties as-is

The following code block creates a standard plugin:

```js
import { definePlugin } from "@eslint/plugin-kit";

import packageData from "../package.json" with { type: "json" };
import { rules } from "./rules/index.js";

export const plugin = definePlugin({
  meta: { name: packageData.name, version: packageData.version },
  rules,
});
```

> `rules` is assumed to be a typical rules definition object like `{ "a": { ... }, ... }`.

That definition would be the equivalent of:

```js
// (equivalent to the previous snippet)

import packageData from "../package.json" with { type: "json" };
import { rules } from "./rules/index.js";

export const plugin = {
  meta: { name: packageData.name, version: packageData.version },
  rules,
};
```

### Configs

An optional `configs` object may be provided to `definePlugin`.
If provided, it acts as a shorthand description of the plugin's exported `configs` property.

`configs` is the only property `definePlugin` receives with a different shape than the output plugin object.
`definePlugin` will apply the following two modifications:

- Keys will have the plugin's name + "/" prepended to them
- Values will be transformed to objects per [Config Values Transformations](#config-values-transformations), and then two properties will be added if they are not present:
  - `name`: the plugin's namespace + `"/"` + the config's key
    - Plugin namespaces are the plugin's `meta.namespace ?? meta.name`
  - `plugin`: merged with an object defining the plugin under its name

The following snippet is what this RFC expects most common community plugins to be structured like:

```ts
const examplePlugin = definePlugin({
  configs: {
    recommended: [myRuleA, myRuleB],
  },
  meta: { name: "example" },
  rules: {
    "my-rule-a": myRuleA,
    "my-rule-b": myRuleB,
  },
});
```

That plugin definition is equivalent to:

```ts
// (equivalent to the previous snippet)
const plugin = {
  configs: {
    recommended: {
      name: "example/recommended",
      plugins: {
        get example() {
          return plugin;
        },
      },
      rules: {
        "example/my-rule-a": "error",
        "example/my-rule-b": "error",
      },
    },
  },
  meta: { name: "example" },
  rules: {
    "my-rule-a": myRuleA,
    "my-rule-b": myRuleB,
  },
});
```

#### Config Values Transformations

The behavior of transforming values under `configs` properties depends on what type of value is provided:

- If provided as an array, it will be transformed to an object with a `rules` property whose keys and values are generated as follows:
  - If it is a rule object itself, the rule will be added with severity `"error"`
  - If it is a tuple of a rule object and severity, the rule will be added with the provided severity
  - If it is any other kind of object, it will be merged as-is
- If provided as a non-array object:
  - Its `rules` value will be transformed with the same logic
  - All other properties will be merged as-is

The following table contains examples of valid elements for `rules` arrays and their equivalent output.

| Element Type                                       | Example Input Element                      | Example Merged Output                        |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `null`                                             | `null`                                     | `undefined`                                  |
| `undefined`                                        | `undefined`                                | `undefined`                                  |
| Rule object                                        | `myRule`                                   | `{ "example/my-rule": "error" }`             |
| Object with string key and severity value          | `{ "example/my-rule": "warn" }`            | `{ "example/my-rule": "warn" }`              |
| Object with string key and severity & option       | `{ "example/my-rule": ["warn", "never"] }` | `{ "example/my-rule": ["warn", "never"] }`   |
| Tuple containing rule object and severity          | `[myRule, "warn"]`                         | `{ "example/my-rule": "warn" }`              |
| Tuple containing rule object and severity & option | `[myRule, ["warn", "never"]]`              | `{ "example/my-rule": ["warn", "never"] }`   |
| Array of objects                                   | `[ { ... }, { ... } ]`                     | `[ { name, plugins, ... }, { ... } ]` **\*** |

**\***If a `config` value is provided as an array of objects, `name` and `plugins` will be set as default values on only the first element.
This allows plugin authors to define plugins with arrays of config objects.
See [Example: Multiple Config Elements](#example-multiple-config-elements).

#### Example: Custom `recommended` Config

This plugin has four rules, `myRuleA`, `myRuleB`, `myRuleC`, and `myRuleD`.
`definePlugin` is used to create a single config containing those four rules with different severities and options:

```ts
const plugin = definePlugin({
  configs: {
    recommended: [
      myRuleA,
      [myRuleB, "error"],
      [myRuleC, "warn"],
      [myRuleD, ["error", "never"]],
    ],
  },
  meta: {
    name: "example",
  },
  rules: {
    "my-rule-a": myRuleA,
    "my-rule-b": myRuleB,
    "my-rule-c": myRuleC,
    "my-rule-d": myRuleD,
  },
});
```

The equivalent generated plugin object would be:

```js
// (equivalent to the previous snippet)

const plugin = {
  configs: {},
  meta: {
    name: "example",
  },
  rules: {
    "my-rule-a": myRuleA,
    "my-rule-b": myRuleB,
    "my-rule-c": myRuleC,
    "my-rule-d": myRuleD,
  },
};

Object.assign(plugin.configs, {
  recommended: [
    {
      name: "example/recommended",
      plugins: {
        example: plugin,
      },
      rules: {
        "example/my-rule-a": "error",
        "example/my-rule-b": "error",
        "example/my-rule-c": "warn",
        "example/my-rule-d": ["error", "never"],
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Example: Filtered Custom Configs

A plugin akin to `typescript-eslint` with `recommended`, `strict`, and `*TypeAware` configs could define those four configs by filtering the values of a `rules` object.
Suppose this plugin's `rules` contains four rules:

1. `my-rule-a`: with `meta.docs = { recommended: true, typeAware: false }`
1. `my-rule-b`: with `meta.docs = { recommended: true, typeAware: true }`
1. `my-rule-c`: with `meta.docs = { recommended: "strict", typeAware: false }`
1. `my-rule-d`: with `meta.docs = { recommended: "strict", typeAware: true }`

Its plugin definition could look like:

```js
const rules = {
  "my-rule-a": myRuleA,
  "my-rule-b": myRuleB,
  "my-rule-c": myRuleC,
  "my-rule-d": myRuleD,
};

definePlugin({
  configs: {
    recommended: Object.values(rules).filter(
      (rule) => rule.meta.docs.recommended
    ),
    recommendedTypeAware: Object.values(rules).filter(
      (rule) => rule.meta.docs.recommended && rule.meta.docs.typeAware
    ),
    strict: Object.values(rules).filter(
      (rule) => rule.meta.docs.recommended === "strict"
    ),
    strictTypeAware: Object.values(rules).filter(
      (rule) =>
        rule.meta.docs.recommended === "strict" && rule.meta.docs.typeAware
    ),
  },
  meta: {
    name: "example",
  },
  rules,
});
```

The equivalent generated plugin object would be:

```js
// (equivalent to the previous snippet)

const plugin = {
  configs: {},
  meta: {
    name: "example",
  },
  rules: {
    "my-rule-a": myRuleA,
    "my-rule-b": myRuleB,
    "my-rule-c": myRuleC,
    "my-rule-d": myRuleD,
  },
};

Object.assign(plugin.configs, {
  recommended: [
    {
      name: "example/recommended",
      plugins: {
        example: plugin,
      },
      rules: {
        "example/my-rule-a": "error",
      },
    },
  ],
  recommendedTypeAware: [
    {
      name: "example/recommendedTypeAware",
      plugins: {
        example: plugin,
      },
      rules: {
        "example/my-rule-a": "error",
        "example/my-rule-b": "error",
      },
    },
  ],
  strict: [
    {
      name: "example/strict",
      plugins: {
        example: plugin,
      },
      rules: {
        "example/my-rule-a": "error",
        "example/my-rule-c": "error",
      },
    },
  ],
  strictTypeAware: [
    {
      name: "example/strictTypeAware",
      plugins: {
        example: plugin,
      },
      rules: {
        "example/my-rule-a": "error",
        "example/my-rule-b": "error",
        "example/my-rule-c": "error",
        "example/my-rule-d": "error",
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Example: Including Additional Options

A plugin that provides additional properties such as `languageOptions` could define them in its `configs.recommended`.
This plugin provides:

- A single rule, `myRule`
- `languageOptions`: as part of its `recommended` config

```js
const plugin = definePlugin({
  configs: {
    recommended: {
      languageOptions: {
        globals: {
          myGlobal: "readonly",
        },
      },
      rules: [myRule],
    },
  },
  meta: {
    name: "example",
  },
  rules: {
    "my-rule": myRule,
  },
});
```

The equivalent generated plugin object would be:

```js
// (equivalent to the previous snippet)

const plugin = {
  configs: {},
  meta: {
    name: "example",
  },
  rules: {
    "my-rule": myRule,
  },
};

Object.assign(plugin.configs, {
  recommended: [
    {
      languageOptions: {
        globals: {
          myGlobal: "readonly",
        },
      },
      name: "example/recommended",
      plugins: {
        example: plugin,
      },
      rules: {
        "example/my-rule": "error",
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Example: Multiple Config Elements

If a plugin provides multiple objects in a `configs` array, only the first object will have `name` and `plugins` added in as defaults.
For example, this plugin is set up akin to the current `eslint-plugin-markdown`.
It provides multiple entries in its `recommended` config and only specifies `rules` in the last element:

```js
const plugin = definePlugin({
  configs: {
    recommended: [
      {
        name: "example/recommended/plugin",
      },
      {
        name: "example/recommended/processor",
        files: ["**/*.md"],
        processor: "example/markdown",
      },
      {
        name: "example/recommended/code-blocks",
        files: ["**/*.md/**"],
        languageOptions: {
          parserOptions: {
            ecmaFeatures: {
              impliedStrict: true,
            },
          },
        },
        rules: [myRule],
      },
    ],
  },
  meta,
  processors: {
    markdown: processor,
  },
  rules: {
    "my-rule": myRule,
  },
});
```

The equivalent generated plugin object would be:

```js
// (equivalent to the previous snippet)

const plugin = {
  configs: {},
  meta: {
    name: "example",
  },
  processors: {
    markdown: processor,
  },
  rules: {
    "my-rule": myRule,
  },
};

Object.assign(plugin.configs, {
  recommended: [
    {
      name: "example/recommended/plugin",
      plugins: {
        example: plugin,
      },
    },
    {
      name: "example/recommended/processor",
      files: ["**/*.md"],
      processor: "example/markdown",
    },
    {
      name: "example/recommended/code-blocks",
      files: ["**/*.md/**"],
      languageOptions: {
        parserOptions: {
          ecmaFeatures: {
            impliedStrict: true,
          },
        },
      },
      rules: {
        "example/my-rule": "error",
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Example: Referencing Other Plugins' Rules

If a `config` value contains an objects with string keys and severity/option values, those objects' keys will not be modified.
This means objects can refer to other plugins' rules.

For example, this plugin sets three rules:

1. `myRule`: its own rule
2. `import/no-anonymous-default-export`: from an external plugin
3. `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`: from an external plugin

Its definition is equivalent to the current `eslint-plugin-storybook`'s referencing of rules from other plugins:

```js
const plugin = definePlugin({
  configs: {
    recommended: {
      rules: [
        myRule,
        {
          "import/no-anonymous-default-export": "off",
          "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "off",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  meta: {
    name: "example",
  },
  rules: {
    "my-rule": myRule,
  },
});
```

The equivalent generated plugin object would be:

```js
// (equivalent to the previous snippet)

const plugin = {
  configs: {},
  meta: {
    name: "example",
  },
  rules: {
    "my-rule": myRule,
  },
};

Object.assign(plugin.configs, {
  recommended: [
    {
      name: "example/recommended",
      plugins: {
        example: plugin,
      },
      rules: {
        "example/my-rule": "error",
        "import/no-anonymous-default-export": "off",
        "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "off",
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Documentation

- The README.md for [`@eslint/plugin-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eslint/plugin-kit) will have a section added for `definePlugin`
- The existing [Create Plugins](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins) page will be updated to use the new helper
  - It can also link to the `@eslint/plugin-kit` README.md section for expanded documentation
  - It will also explicitly note that the helper is optional
- Explanatory documentation in the new `eslint-plugin-eslint-plugin` lint rules

## Drawbacks

Adding one more function to learn increases the barrier to entry to authoring plugins.
Developers may not want a helper that they need to understand alongside the existing concepts.
Some might find that obfuscating plugin definitions in this way is conceptual overhead costlier than the current act of writing portions manually.

Adding a first-party standardized config also runs the risk of forcing the community into patterns it does not want.
Authors may find the `definePlugin`-style `configs` cumbersome, for example, and might opt not to use the helper factory as a result.
If a super-majority of plugin authors don't onboard to `definePlugin` then this RFC might lead to an increase in plugin definition styles.

This RFC believes that the net benefits of a first-party `definePlugin` outweigh the risks.
Given how many existing plugins seem to adhere to similar patterns, it is likely that this RFC will net reduce, not increase, implementation divergence.

## Backwards Compatibility Analysis

Fully backward compatible with no breaking changes.
The new `definePlugin` would be opt-in and optional.

### Design Pattern Analysis

Beyond technical breaking changes, this design also needs to work conceptually with how community authors want to define their plugins.
`configs` in particular is a design change that needs to be not break existing patterns.

All non-deprecated plugins with a â _Status_ in [ð Tracking: Flat Config Support](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18093) can be represented with the `configs` functions style of definition.

Emoji key:

- âï¸: Exposes just a `recommended` config, optionally alongside `all`, `flat/*`, `legacy-*`, and/or `*-legacy` variants
- âï¸: Exposes multiple configs that are or could be auto-generated from existing values in code
- ð ï¸: Exposes multiple configs that could be represented this way by adding 1-2 properties to `meta.rule.docs`
- â: Does not export configs with its own rules to begin with

## Alternatives

It might be preferable to release `definePlugin` as a community-authored plugin before standardizing it in `@eslint/plugin-kit`.
Doing so could allow for more rapid changes as community plugins adopt it.
This RFC prefers making the function first-party for visibility and to encourage confidence in plugin author adoption.

### Lazy-Loading Rules

This RFC previously suggested providing features and lint rules around lazy-loading rules.
Doing so would allow plugins to reduce their startup times.
However, lazy-loading requires a non-trivial increase in design complexity.
This RFC now treats lazy-loading as out of scope.

See [5d2557 > 2025-define-plugin/README.md#L705](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/blob/5d2557787574e85c0e9413ba8cfa75f9215673b8/designs/2025-define-plugin/README.md?plain=1#L705) for the latest version of the RFC that proposed lazy-loading rules.

## Open Questions

### Config Arrays

`eslint-plugin-markdown` defines an unusual `plugin.configs.processor`:

- An array of config objects instead of just one
- `name` with `/plugin` at the end
- `rules` in the last config object rather than the first

Is it acceptable to change `eslint-plugin-markdown`'s structure to what's suggested under [Example: Multiple Config Elements](#example-multiple-config-elements)

### Legacy Configs

Many plugins include `legacy-*` eslintrc configs as suggested in [Backwards Compatibility for Legacy Configs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins#backwards-compatibility-for-legacy-configs).
Dropping those configs would be a breaking change that those plugins may want to avoid.
This conflicts with `definePlugin` explicitly only supporting flat config definitions.

Plugin developers can work around that lack of support by manually adding those config properties:

```js
const plugin = definePlugin({ meta, rules });

// TODO: Remove when we drop support for ESLint <=9 / eslintrc
plugin.configs["legacy-recommended"] = {
  plugin: ["example"],
  rules: Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(rules)
      .filter(([, rule]) => rule.meta.docs?.recommended)
      .map(([ruleName]) => [ruleName, "error"])
  ),
};
```

Is this an acceptable workaround strategy?

### Rule Creators

This RFC's scope intentionally does include a "rule creator" factory akin to [`@typescript-eslint/rule-creator`](https://typescript-eslint.io/developers/custom-rules/#rulecreator).
Creating such a factory in ESLint could be useful but does not seem to be required for any of the problems `definePlugin` aims to solve.

Should a "rule creator" factory be tackled separately?

## Help Needed

I would love to implement this RFC.

I can also:

- Post this RFC in relevant Discords to draw plugin author attention to it
- Work with `eslint-plugin-eslint-plugin` on feature requests for the proposed lint rules as part of this RFC
- Send draft PRs to community plugins to help onboard them to the new `definePlugin`

### Plugin Testing

`definePlugin` should be tested before release on at least the plugins defined in [2024-repo-ecosystem-plugin-tests](../2024-repo-ecosystem-plugin-tests/README.md).
This will ensure coverage of at least the following cases:

- `.js` files with `.d.ts` siblings
  - Test cases should be added to ensure [eslint/markdown#402 bug: `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` causes type errors when using plugins that were not built with this option](https://github.com/eslint/markdown/issues/402) is fixed and does not regress
- `.ts` files

If other plugin authors would like to test it out, that would be appreciated and helpful.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### `configs`: Can config generation be made more automatic based on `meta.docs`?

Or: why not define only one function that, given a rule, generates a config or array of configs?
That would suggest using something the following function by default:

```js
const plugin = definePlugin({
  configs: (rule) => rule.meta.docs.recommended,
  meta,
  rules,
});
```

This design would make it difficult to create additional properties for individual configs.
For example, if a plugin exports two configs and only one adds `languageOptions`, it would require additional complexity added to the singular function.

Furthermore, dynamically generating strings is a more complex mental model for plugin authors.
As a result it's also a more complex system to model in type system types for `definePlugin`.
Doing so would at the very least require `definePlugin` to have a type parameter representing the shape of `rule.meta.docs`.
Any operation beyond rudimentary boolean checks or string concatenation would be difficult or impossible to describe even with that information.

This RFC believes requiring a single function per config makes for more clear, readable plugin definitions and is worth the -typically small- number of extra lines.

### `configs`: Should a `recommended` config also be automatically generated?

Earlier versions of this RFC suggested automatically adding a `recommended` config based on rules' `meta.docs.recommended` properties.
This was removed to keep the RFC and `definePlugin` cleaner and simpler.

A future version of `definePlugin` could add this feature.
It would likely be discussed as part of a separate helper function or a new option like `autoConfig: true`.

### `configs`: Should an `all` config also be automatically generated?

Not according to how plugins seem to be authored today.
Some plugins do contain config(s) enabling all their rules in some way.
However, no plugins prominently recommend those "all" configs, and many don't have one at all.

### `configs`: Will the added restrictions break existing plugin design patterns?

Not according to how plugins seem to be authored today.
See [Design Pattern Analysis](#design-pattern-analysis).

This RFC believes that the proposed style of definition directly maps to how users generally expect to understand configs.
As in: each config represents a set of rules filtered from the full list of plugin rules.
Standardizing config logic will encourage plugin authors to continue making predictable plugin config designs.

Plugin authors can always opt out of using `definePlugin` if they want their own, very different style.

### `meta`: Why is `meta.name` required?

It's used to generate keys in `configs[string].rules` objects.

### `configs`: Why generate at all?

The majority of described logic in this RFC is to support automatically generating `configs` for users.
An alternative, leaner approach would be to omit any kind of config generation logic.
Doing so would keep `definePlugin` as a type system / editor Intellisense helper akin to `defineConfig()`.

However, because plugins' `configs[string].plugins` properties may refer to the plugin, there is no way to create a `definePlugin` function that both:

- Allows users to generate a plugin in one statement (i.e. without an `Object.assign` or equivalent)
- Avoids any kind of dynamic `configs` generation (e.g. adding in `plugins` to a config)

The leanest possible approach that keeps plugin generation to one statement would be to only add in the `plugins` property.
For example, this plugin with a single rule could use a version of `definePlugin` that doesn't modify any `rules` properties:

```ts
export const plugin = definePlugin({
  configs: {
    recommended: {
      rules: {
        "example/my-rule": myRule,
      },
    },
  },
  meta: {
    name: "example",
  },
  rules: {
    "my-rule": myRule,
  },
});
```

It might then generate the equivalent config with `plugins`:

```js
// (equivalent to the previous snippet)

import { definePlugin } from "@eslint/plugin-kit";

const plugin = {
  meta: {
    name: "example",
  },
  rules: {
    "my-rule": myRule,
  },
};

Object.assign(plugin.configs, {
  recommended: [
    {
      name: "example/recommended",
      plugins: {
        example: plugin,
      },
      rules: {
        "example/my-rule": myRule,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

This RFC believes that including automatic `rule` generation is worth inclusion.
It allows for even more straightforward, simpler plugin definitions.
